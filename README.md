# offersAndCoupons

Project developed during the **Android Architecture course by Platzi** which explores the MVC, MVP and MVVM architectures for the same app. The app consumes the API from https://linkmydeals.com/ to show a list of coupons and offers to the users.

You will find a different branch for each android architecture approach.
